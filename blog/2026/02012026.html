        <h2>Rational Rank Conjecture?</h2>
        <p>
            Last year in the UBC CS Theory Seminar, Lianna Hambardzumyan from UVic presented their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02583">work</a> on a new equivalent formulation of the log-rank conjecture. They defined a new complexity measure for Boolean matrices, the signed rectangle rank, denoted $\srr$, and showed that it is polynomially related to the rank, denoted $r$, through the following relation:
            $$\srr\leq O(r\log r).$$
            This article will discuss the proof of this result, and some thoughts about different notions of rank of Boolean matrices, and their connections to communication complexity.
        </p>
        <h3>Communication is bounded by Rank (not log-rank unfortunately...)</h3>
        <p>
            As a warmup for next section, I will show that $D(M)\leq \rk(M)+1$ for any Boolean matrix $M$, where $D(M)$ is the deterministic communication complexity of $M$. The main idea is to show that $M$ can have at most $2^{\rk(M)}$ distinct columns, hence we can design a communication protocol by encoding the distinct columns with $\log_2 2^{\rk(M)}=\rk(M)$ bits and compute the function using $\rk(M)+1$ bits.
        </p>
        <p>
            We now proceed to show that a rank $r$ Boolean matrix $M$ can have at most $r$ distinct columns (and rows).
        </p>
        <details open>
            <summary>Proof</summary>
            <p>
                Take a linearly independent set of rows of $M$, and put them in a matrix $R$. Then $M$ can be factored to $M=C\cdot R$ for a unique matrix $C$ with $r$ columns. By our choice, the matrix $R$ is Boolean, so it can have at most $2^r$ distinct columns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now this means that $M$ must also have at most $2^r$ distinct columns, since the linear map associated with matrix $C$ is injective, as desired. $\Box$
            </p>
        </details>
        <h3>Signed Rectangle Rank</h3>
        <p>
            The signed rectangle rank of a Boolean matrix $M$ is defined as the minimum number of $\pm 1$ linear combinations of rank $1$ Boolean matrices that sums to $M$. We see that $\rk(M)\leq \srr(M)\leq \chi_1(M)$, where $\chi_1(M)$ is the partition number of $M$, defined as the minimum number of primitive matrices that sums to $M$.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the original paper, they defined a set $S$ of columns of $M$ to be <strong>independent</strong> if all $2^{|S|}$ possible subset sums are distinct. The result $\srr(M)\leq O(\rk(M)\log \rk(M))$ follows from two claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            Claim 1: For any independent subset $S$ of $M$, $|S|\leq O(\rk(M)\log \rk(M))$.
        </p>
        <details open>
            <summary>Proof</summary>
            <p>
                We show this by double counting. Put all elements of $S$ in a matrix $N$, and let $P$ be a $|S|\times 2^{|S|}$ Boolean matrix where all columns are distinct. Then $N\cdot P$ is a matrix whose columns are all distinct subset sums of $S$.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now factor matrix $N$ into $N=C\cdot R$, where $R$ consists of $\rk(M)$ linearly independent rows of $S$. Now $N\cdot P=C\cdot (R\cdot P)$. Notice that $R\cdot P$ is a $\rk(M)\times 2^{|S|}$ matrix, with entries in $\{0,1,\dots,|S|\}$. Therefore it has at most $(1+|S|)^{\rk(M)}$ distinct columns. Since $C$ is injective, $C\cdot (R\cdot P)$ has at most $(1+|S|)^{\rk(M)}$ distinct columns, which means that
                $$2^{|S|}\leq (1+|S|)^{\rk(M)},$$
                and rearranging gives
                $$|S|\leq O(\rk(M)\log \rk(M)),$$
                as claimed. $\Box$
            </p>
        </details>
        <p>Claim 2: Let $S$ be a maximal independent set of $M$. Then any column of $M$ is a $\pm 1$ linear combination of elements in $S$.</p>
        <details open>
            <summary>Proof</summary>
            <p>
                For any column of $M$ not in $S$, by maximality of $S$, there must exist a subset sum $v_+$ of $S$ and a subset sum $v_-$ of $S$ such that $v_-+v=v_+$, which gives $v=v_+-v_-$, that is, $v$ is a $\pm 1$ linear combination of elements in $S$, as claimed. $\Box$
            </p>
        </details>
        <p>
            From these two claims, it's now easy to see that $M$ can be written as a $\pm 1$ linear combination of at most $O(\rk(M)\log \rk(M))$ rank $1$ Boolean matrices.
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Non-deterministic Rank</h3>
        <p>
            Let $M$ be an $n\times m$ Boolean matrix over $\RR$. We say that a matrix $A$ is a non-deterministic representation (or support-represention) of $M$ if $M_{ij}=1\Leftrightarrow A_{ij}\neq 0$. Define the <strong>non-deterministic rank</strong> of $M$, denoted $\nrk(M)$, as the minimum rank over all non-deterministic representations of $M$. This notion has been studied in quantum communication complexity (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0001014">this</a>), where $\nrk(M)$ is related to non-deterministic quantum communication complexity through the following tight connection:
            $$NQcc(M)=\lfloor \log \nrk(M)\rfloor+1,$$
            where $NQcc(M)$ is the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that $\nrk(M)$ can be constant even when $\rk(M)$ is almost full. For example, consider the matrix $M=J_n-I_n$. This has $\rk(M)=\Theta(n)$, yet $\nrk(M)=O(1)$, since it can be non-deterministically represented as the following difference of rank $1$ matrices:
            $$\begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 2 & 4 & \cdots & 2^{n-1}\\
                2 & 4 & 8 & \cdots & 2^n\\
                \vdots &\vdots & \ddots &\vdots & \vdots\\
                2^{n-2} & 2^{n-1} &\cdots &\cdots & 2^{2n-3}\\
                2^{n-1} & 2^n &\cdots &\cdots & 2^{2n-2}
            \end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}
                1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
                4 & 4 & 4 & \cdots & 4\\
                \vdots &\vdots & \ddots &\vdots & \vdots\\
                2^{2n-4} & 2^{2n-4} &\cdots &\cdots & 2^{2n-4}\\
                2^{2n-2} & 2^{2n-2} &\cdots &\cdots & 2^{2n-2}
            \end{pmatrix}$$
        </p>
        <h3>Rational Rank</h3>
        <p>
            Motivated by rational degree of Boolean functions, where $\rdeg(f)=\max\{\ndeg(f),\ndeg(\neg f)\}$, we can defined the <strong>rational rank</strong> of $M$ as $\rrk(M)=\max\{\nrk(M),\nrk(\neg M)\}$. Some natural question about this notion is, whether $\rrk(M)$ is polynomially or quasi-polynomially related to $\rk(M)$. Notice that since $|\rk(M)-\rk(\neg M)|\leq 1$, this question is the same as asking the relation between $\rrk(\neg M)$ and $\rk(\neg M)$. I do not have any immediate counterexample for this question. Another question is whether this relates to any computational complexity measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something that I currently can show is that
            $$\max(\nrk(M),\nrk(\neg M))\geq \Omega(\log \rk(M)).$$
            This follows from lemma 3.6 of <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/066/">this paper</a> that $M$ contains at least one of $M$ must contains a submatrix equal to one of $I_k, \neg I_k, GT_k, \neg GT_k$ for $k=\Omega(\log \rk(M))$, where $GT_k$ is the upper triangular Boolean matrix on $k$ variables. This is very similar to the claim that all Boolean functions that depends on $n$ variables restricts to a non-trivial symmetric function on $\log^*(n)$ number of variables. Notice that all $4$ of these matrices have rational rank at least $k$, so the inequality follows.
